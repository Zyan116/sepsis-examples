# sepsis-examples
This repository contains all the code necessary to replicate the results of the paper "Methods for Off-policy Evaluation Under Unobserved Confounding", where the simulator used for generating observations, packages for importance sampling estimation and bounds computation, and the code for design sensitivity analysis in the first example are written based on Namkoong's code which is available online at \url{https://github.com/StanfordAI4HI/off_policy_confounding/tree/master/sepsis}, and the simulator used for generating observations and the code for counterfactual evaluation in the second example are coded based on Oberst's work which is available online at \url{https://github.com/clinicalml/gumbel-max-scm}.
